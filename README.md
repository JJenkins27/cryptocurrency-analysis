# Cryptocurrency Analysis

Using Unsupervised Machine Learning, Python, Pandas, and Jupyter Notebook to analyze cryptocurrency data

## Overview of Project

An analysis of cryptocurrency data. Data was cleaned for processing through unsupervised learning, reduced using PCA, clustered using K-means, and visualized. 

### Purpose

Accountability Accounting, an investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its clients. The results are visualized using unsupervised learning to show which cryptocurrencies are available on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system.
